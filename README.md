# KEO CLS.EEDI

This is the documentation of the KEO CLS.EEDI protocol. KEO CLS.EEDI allows energy grid related backend systems (e.g. aEMT) to exchange energy management related data with local systems (e.g. SMGW, FFN Steuerbox).

Requests for collaboration will be welcomed. Feel free to open issues in this repository or contact cls.eedi@keo-connectivity.de.

# Building

To render the documentation check and use `build.sh`. Dependencies for building are `doxygen` and `plantuml`.
